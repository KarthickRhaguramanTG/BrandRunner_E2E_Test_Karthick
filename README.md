# CloudWatch Synthetics Canary

A lightweight, six-step API health/smoke journey (`ApiHealthCanary`) that runs
periodically through AWS CloudWatch Synthetics, reusing this project's existing
REST Assured framework. It is completely separate from the TestNG regression
suite - it never invokes a TestNG test, and `mvn clean test` is unaffected by
any of this.

## Architecture

```
CloudWatch Synthetics
        |
ApiHealthCanary            (ai.metayb.canary - new, main-scope)
        |
CanaryApiSessionClient      (ai.metayb.api.client - new, main-scope)
        |
REST Assured (SanitizedApiLoggingFilter attached, same as every TestNG API test)
        |
BrandRunners Web API
```

`CanaryApiSessionClient` is a small extraction of `testUtils.BaseApiTest`'s
login/request-spec logic into main-scope code - `BaseApiTest` itself is
untouched. See that class's Javadoc for exactly why it can't be reused
directly (it's test-scope, so it never ships in a packaged jar, and its auth
state is static/suite-scoped, which a Canary must not reuse).

## Canary steps

Sequential, because each step after Login needs the token/business_unit
Login produced. Every endpoint below is one already covered by a live-verified
TestNG test - see `ApiHealthCanary`'s per-step comments for exactly which one.

| # | Step | Endpoint | Validates |
|---|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Login | `POST /web/auth/login` | `accessToken` cookie + business unit id present |
| 2 | Current Session | `GET /web/session` | HTTP 200, `data.id`/`email`/`roleName`, non-empty `data.permissions` |
| 3 | Control Settings | `GET /web/settings/app-settings` | HTTP 200, `data.masterData.locationHierarchies`, `data.storedData.appSettings` |
| 4 | ANP Health | `GET /web/dashboard/counter` | HTTP 200, `data.totalUsers`, `data.totalTasks` |
| 5 | FWM Health | `GET /web/fwm-dashboard/status-summary?date=<today>&locationId=null&designationId=null` | HTTP 200, `data.statusSummary`. Date is computed fresh each run - never hardcoded. |
| 6 | Sales Health | `GET /web/sales-report/activity-lists` | HTTP 200, non-empty `data.details` |

**Known gap**: the actual `04. Sales` Postman folder has never been automated
or live-verified in this project, so there is no genuine "Sales" smoke
endpoint yet. Step 6 uses `03. FWM / Reports - Sales`'s `activity-lists`
endpoint as a verified stand-in. Revisit once `04. Sales` gets its own
automation pass.

## Handler

```
ai.metayb.canary.ApiHealthCanary::canaryCode
```

Verified against the SDK's actual current source (`aws/aws-cloudwatch-synthetics-sdk-java`
on GitHub) rather than AWS's own docs page, which shows a stale
`com.amazonaws.synthetics.Synthetics` import - the real, current package is
`software.amazon.synthetics`.

## Configuration

Layered, env vars taking priority over local config - never the other way
around:

```
CloudWatch env var  -->  existing local config (config.properties / credentials.properties)
```

| Variable | Required | Sensitive | Falls back to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `API_BASE_URL` | No | No | `config/config.properties`'s `api.base.url` |
| `API_TENANT` | No | No | `config/config.properties`'s `api.tenant` |
| `CANARY_USERNAME` | No | No (unless you'd rather keep it secret too - see below) | Secrets Manager secret's `username` field, then `config/credentials.properties`'s `apiEmail` |
| `CANARY_PASSWORD` | No | **Yes** | Only used if `CANARY_SECRET_ID` is not set |
| `CANARY_SECRET_ID` | No | No (it's an ARN/name, not a secret itself) | If set, credentials come from Secrets Manager instead of `CANARY_USERNAME`/`CANARY_PASSWORD` |

A real CloudWatch deployment should set `CANARY_SECRET_ID` (see below) rather
than `CANARY_PASSWORD` directly. `credentials.properties` is a **local-dev-only**
fallback - the deployed Canary artifact deliberately does not include that
file at all (see "Packaging" below), so in a real deployment this fallback
path is unreachable unless something is misconfigured, in which case the
Canary fails cleanly with a message telling you exactly which variable is
missing (never a stack trace with no explanation).

## Secrets Manager

Preferred way to supply credentials in CloudWatch. One secret, JSON-format:

```json
{
  "username": "canary@example.com",
  "password": "<real password - never committed anywhere>"
}
```

`username` is optional in the secret - if you'd rather keep the login email
out of Secrets Manager entirely, omit it and set `CANARY_USERNAME` as a plain
(non-secret) environment variable instead; `password` is always required
whenever `CANARY_SECRET_ID` is set. Set `CANARY_SECRET_ID` to the secret's
name or ARN. Nothing in source code, `config.properties`, `synthetics.json`,
or the generated ZIP ever contains a real credential - see "Security /
logging validation" below for how that was verified.

## Logging

`ApiHealthCanary` points Log4j2 at a dedicated `log4j2-canary.xml`
(console-only) before any Logger is first obtained, instead of the existing
`log4j2.xml` used by every UI/API/mobile test. That file's `RollingFile`
appender writes to a relative `logs/` path that isn't writable (or visible in
CloudWatch Logs) inside the Synthetics Lambda runtime - reusing it as-is would
make every Canary run emit noisy "unable to create file" diagnostics for an
appender that can never do anything useful there. The existing `log4j2.xml`
is untouched and still applies to every other execution path.

`SanitizedApiLoggingFilter` (already used by every TestNG API test) is reused
unchanged - `Authorization`/`Cookie`/`Set-Cookie`/`cron-secret` headers and
secret-shaped JSON fields are masked exactly as they already are in the
regression suite.

## Build

```bash
mvn clean package -Pcanary
```

Default `mvn clean test` / `mvn clean package` are completely unaffected -
the canary jar/zip only get built when `-Pcanary` is passed explicitly.

## Generated artifact

```
target/canary.zip
```

Structure:

```

│   ├── end-to-end-testing-1.0-SNAPSHOT-canary.jar   (this project's own classes + a filtered
│   │                                                  resource set - see "Packaging" below)

└── synthetics.json
```

## Packaging

`config/credentials.properties` (a real, committed local-dev password) lives
in the same `src/main/resources` directory every other main-scope class
shares, and Maven's default jar packages that whole directory. Reusing the
project's normal jar as-is would therefore have shipped that file - and
several irrelevant UI/mobile binaries (`test-data/AutoIT/*.exe`, a sample
image, an Excel fixture) - inside the Canary artifact. Instead, the `canary`
Maven profile builds a **separate, filtered jar** (classifier `canary`) that
excludes:

- `config/credentials.properties`, `config/input.properties`, `config/mobile/**`
- `test-data/**`
- `log4j2.xml` (the Canary uses `log4j2-canary.xml` instead)
- `META-INF/services/**` (a Selenium-specific SPI registration, unrelated to the Canary)

`config/config.properties` (base URL/tenant - not a secret) is kept, since
`CanaryConfig`'s local-dev fallback path reads it.

The dependency jars in `lib/` are filtered too (`src/assembly/canary-zip.xml`),
since every dependency in this shared `pom.xml` - Selenium, Appium, Selenide,
WebDriverManager, POI, Cucumber, Allure, TestNG, ExtentReports - is declared
at ordinary "compile" scope (the whole project shares one `pom.xml` by
design), so Maven's own scope filtering can't tell "used by the Canary" apart
from "used by the Selenium tests." Every exclude in that file was verified
against a real `mvn dependency:tree` run to confirm it has no other consumer,
and the final `lib/` set was verified empirically (not just reasoned about) by
running the actual Canary logic with *only* those extracted jars on the
classpath - see "Local Canary validation" below.

## Local Canary validation

Runs the real `ApiHealthCanary.canaryCode(...)` against a `LocalSyntheticsStub`
(a minimal stand-in for the managed Synthetics runtime) - no CloudWatch/AWS
infrastructure required, unless you deliberately set `CANARY_SECRET_ID` to
test the Secrets Manager path.

```bash
mvn -q dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=cp.txt -Dmdep.includeScope=test
java -cp "target/classes;target/test-classes;@cp.txt" ai.metayb.canary.local.LocalCanaryRunner
```

(or run `ai.metayb.canary.local.LocalCanaryRunner#main` directly from an IDE).
Both `LocalCanaryRunner` and `LocalSyntheticsStub` live under `src/test/java`
specifically so they can never end up in the packaged Canary artifact.

## CloudWatch setup (manual - not automated by this codebase)

1. **Create canary** in the CloudWatch Synthetics console.
2. **Select the Java runtime** (`syn-java-1.0`).
3. **Upload `target/canary.zip`** (built via `mvn clean package -Pcanary`) as the canary code, or reference it from S3.
4. **Set the handler** to `ai.metayb.canary.ApiHealthCanary::canaryCode`.
5. **Set environment variables**: `API_BASE_URL`, `API_TENANT`, `CANARY_SECRET_ID` (and `CANARY_USERNAME` if you're keeping the login email non-secret).
6. **Grant Secrets Manager access**: attach `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` scoped to the one secret's ARN on the canary's execution role (see IAM below).
7. **Configure the execution role**: either let the console create one (it adds the standard Synthetics permissions automatically), or attach a role with the minimum permissions listed below.
8. **Configure the S3 artifact location** (a `cw-syn-results-*` bucket, or your own - the execution role needs `s3:PutObject` there).
9. **Run a test/dry run** and confirm all six steps pass in the step report before scheduling anything recurring.
10. **Configure the schedule** (e.g. every 5 or 15 minutes - this is a lightweight health check, not a load test).
11. **Enable the canary.**

## IAM - minimum permissions for the execution role

Do not use `AdministratorAccess`. Trust policy: `lambda.amazonaws.com` (canaries run as Lambda functions under the hood).

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-canary-results-bucket>/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["logs:CreateLogGroup", "logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:PutLogEvents"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/lambda/cwsyn-*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "cloudwatch:PutMetricData",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "cloudwatch:namespace": "CloudWatchSynthetics" } }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:<your-canary-secret-name>-*"
    }
  ]
}
```

(`xray:PutTraceSegments` on `*` too, only if X-Ray tracing is enabled for the canary.)

## Recommended CloudWatch alarms

- **Canary failure** - alarm on the `Failed` metric (per-canary, `CanaryName` dimension) being `> 0`.
- **Success percentage** - alarm on `SuccessPercent` dropping below a threshold (e.g. `< 100` for a few consecutive periods, to avoid alerting on one transient blip).
- **Step-level failures** - each step emits its own `SuccessPercent`/`Duration` (per `synthetics.json`'s `stepSuccessMetric`/`stepDurationMetric`); alarm on `Login`'s specifically if you want an early, more specific signal than the aggregate.
- **Duration** - alarm if total run duration trends up significantly over baseline; a slow-but-passing canary is often the earliest sign of real API degradation.

Not created automatically by this codebase - configure these in CloudWatch once the canary is running.
