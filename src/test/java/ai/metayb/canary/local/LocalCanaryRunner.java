/**
 * Runs the real ApiHealthCanary.canaryCode(...) logic locally against a
 * LocalSyntheticsStub, without any CloudWatch/AWS Synthetics infrastructure.
 *
 * This validates exactly what Section 10 asks for: configuration loading,
 * login, token propagation, all six steps in sequence, exception handling,
 * logging, and (by inspecting the console output afterward) that nothing
 * sensitive got logged. It reuses the production handler class directly -
 * this is not a reimplementation or a mock of the Canary's own logic, only of
 * the Synthetics runtime around it.
 *
 * Needs no AWS credentials UNLESS CANARY_SECRET_ID is set in the environment,
 * in which case Secrets Manager genuinely is being exercised on purpose - see
 * README "Local Canary validation" for both modes.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   mvn test-compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=ai.metayb.canary.local.LocalCanaryRunner -Dexec.classpathScope=test
 * or run main() directly from an IDE.
